## Technologies Used

- [React](https://react.dev): React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.
- [React Router Dom](https://reactrouter.com): React Router Dom is used to build single-page applications i.e. applications that have many pages or components but the page is never refreshed instead the content is dynamically fetched based on the URL.
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query): React Query is a data-fetching and state management library for React applications that simplifies fetching, caching, and updating data.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev): Vite is a new breed of frontend build tooling that significantly improves the frontend development experience. It consists of two major parts:
	- A dev server that serves your source files over native ES modules, with rich built-in features and astonishingly fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
    - A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.
